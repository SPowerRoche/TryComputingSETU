# TRY Computing at SETU

Try Computing is an interactive event for sixth year, fifth year, transition year and further education students interested in a career in ICT (Information & Communication Technology).

Students will participate in practical exercises with experienced lecturing staff which will explore the general area of computer science. This relates directly to courses on offer at SETU, such as Computer Science, Software Systems Development, Computer Forensics and Security, Creative Computing and Information Technology. This event will give the participants a tour of the computing facilities, where they will be given an 'Hour of Code' workshop, as well as other talks and demonstrations.
