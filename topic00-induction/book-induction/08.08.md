# Is there an shorter way of writing all the code

**Yes**

Instead of coding each individual black square we could code all the squares in a line


~~~  

    size(200, 200);
    fill(0);
    //line 1
    rect(40,0,110,10);

    //line 2
    rect(40,10,90,10);

    rect(150,10,10,10);
    //line 3
    rect(40,20,90,10);

    rect(150,20,10,10);
    //line 4
    rect(40,30,110,10);

    //line 5
    rect(40,40,90,10);

    //line 6
    rect(40,50,90,10);


    //line 7
    rect(0,60,170,10);


    //line 8
    rect(10,70,150,10);

There are nearly always better ways of doing the same thing, but you can only learn that when you understand the basic way of doing it!
