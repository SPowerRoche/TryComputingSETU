# Lets get Animating


**setup()**

- Runs once at the start.

- Good for setting canvas size, starting values, loading images.

**draw()**

- Runs 60 times per second (a loop).

- This is what creates animation.

- Anything inside draw happens again and again.

**Variables for animation**

- x stores the circle’s position.

- Each frame, we increase x → movement.

**Other in-built Methods**

- we will use built-in methods to make our life easier (we don't have to make everything from scratch) 
- circle(centreX, centreY, diameter) e.g. circle(100, 100, 50);

# Lets get started?
 
 Enter the following code:

 
- Enter the following code in your sketchbook:

~~~java
float x = 0;

void setup() {
  size(600, 400);
  fill(100, 200, 255);
}

void draw() {
  background(20, 20, 30);
  x = (x + 2) % width;
  ellipse(x, height/2, 80, 80);
  
} 
~~~
- Run the code, by clicking on the **play** button

- What is happening?  Any idea why the circle is moving?
