# KeyPress and MousePress functions

## Lets change the colour when we press a key

Add the following code to your draw() function

~~~java
if (keyPressed) {
    if (key == 'r') 
      fill(255, 0, 0);
    else if (key == 'g') 
      fill(0, 255, 0);
  }

~~~

Play it and see what happens when you press r on your keyboard.

Could you add the code for b (blue)?
Or, another key to produce a random colour?


## What is mousePressed()?

**mousePressed()** is a built-in Processing function that runs automatically whenever the user clicks the mouse button.

- You do not call it yourself

- Processing calls it whenever a mouse click happens

- It only runs once per click

- This is different from draw() which runs many times per second.

- mousePressed() runs only on the exact frame when the click occurs.
 
 You use mousePressed() when you want something to change when the mouse is clicked, such as:

## Changing a colour

- Moving a shape

- Showing/hiding something

- Starting or stopping an animation

- Making simple buttons

## What information do you get?

When the mouse is clicked, Processing automatically updates:

- **mouseX** = the current x-position of the mouse

- **mouseY** = the current y-position of the mouse

So you can check where the click happened.

**Example**

Changes the background colour when clicked

~~~java
color bg = color(200, 200, 255); // starting background

void setup() {
  size(400, 300);
}

void draw() {
  background(bg);
}

void mousePressed() {
  // Change to a new random colour
  bg = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
}
