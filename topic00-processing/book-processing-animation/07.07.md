# Lets change the colour when we press a key

Add the following code to your draw() function

~~~java
if (keyPressed) {
    if (key == 'r') 
      fill(255, 0, 0);
    else if (key == 'g') 
      fill(0, 255, 0);
  }

~~~

Play it and see what happens when you press r on your keyboard.

Could you add the code for b (blue)?
Or, another key to produce a random colour?
