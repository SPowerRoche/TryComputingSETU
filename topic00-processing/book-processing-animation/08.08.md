# Putting it together: A “Scene” with Sequence

- Create a simple “scene” using shapes, where order matters:

    - A background sky
    - A house (rectangle) 
    - A tree (trunk rectangle + foliage as circles or ellipses) — experiment whether foliage appears in front or behind house depending on order
    - A sun (circle)

**Using the previous code for the moving ball, could you make the sun move accross the scene?**
