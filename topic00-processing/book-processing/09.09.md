# Setting up your folder structure

It is really important to organise where you store all your college files/ software. If you don’t do this early, chaos will ensue! The best way is to organise your files from the start. You can use this file structure on Cloud (OneDrive?) and mirror it on your labtop so you can ’backup’ easily by dragging the full folder from one to the other

A suggested filing system is given above. 

**Note** you could have subfolders named Week 1 etc. whichever is most appropriate.  Having set this up, you will get used to using this very quickly and you will save a lot of time in the long run.
